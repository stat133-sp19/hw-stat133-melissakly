* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup (120 ml) water
* 1/3 cup (80 ml) olive oil plus more for brushing
* Flaky sea salt such as Maldon

__Tools__:
* parchment paper
* baking sheet
* cooling rack

__Steps__:
1. Preheat oven to 450°F with a heavy baking sheet on rack in middle.
1. Stir together flour, chopped rosemary, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. 
1. Add water and oil and gradually stir into flour with a wooden spoon until a dough forms. Knead dough gently on a work surface 4 or 5 times.
1. Divide dough into 3 pieces and roll out 1 piece on a sheet of parchment paper
1. Sprinkle with sea salt and bake 8 to 10 minutes.
1. Transfer flatbread to a rack to cool

## 3. Eucildean Distance

### Definition

***

The <b>Euclidean distance</b> between points <b>p</b> and <b>q</b> is the length of the line segment connecting them $\overline{\mathbf{p}\mathbf{q}}$. In Cartesian coordinates, if <b>p</b> = (<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>,..., <i>p</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>) and <b>q</b> = (<i>q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>q</i><sub>2</sub>,..., <i>q</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from <b>p</b> to <b>q</b>, or from <b>q</b> to <b>p</b> is given by the Pythagorean formula: 


$\begin{aligned}d(\mathbf {p} ,\mathbf {q} )=d(\mathbf {q} ,\mathbf {p} )={\sqrt {(q_{1}-p_{1})^{2}+(q_{2}-p_{2})^{2}+\cdots +(q_{n}-p_{n})^{2}}}\\[8pt]={\sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n}(q_{i}-p_{i})^{2}}}.\end{aligned}$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, <b>p</b> and <b>q</b> may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The <b>Euclidean norm</b> or <b>Euclidean length</b>, or <b>magnitude</b> of a vector measures the length of the vector:

${\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {p} \right\|={\sqrt {p_{1}^{2}+p_{2}^{2}+\cdots +p_{n}^{2}}}={\sqrt {\mathbf {p} \cdot \mathbf {p} }},}$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
